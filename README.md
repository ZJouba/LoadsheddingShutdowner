# üõ°Ô∏èShed Shield
Shed Shield uses the [EskomSePush](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1296288/UzQuNk3E#intro) API along with [Nominatum](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ui/about.html) to look up your zone and adds a cron job to shutdown your PC before loadshedding cuts the power.

# üîß Key Features
* Shed Shield uses geolocation to find your closest zone
* Shed Shield can monitor multiple zones
* Shed Shield uses the most immediate loadshedding timeslot to schedule a shutdown
* Shed Shield can be configured to shutdown at specified intervals before loadshedding
